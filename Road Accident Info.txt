🌟 This week I finished my training on the Excel dashboard and now the interactive dashboard is ready! 🚀

So I needed something to monitor some indicators of accidents at night, the causes of accidents, the most accident-related machines, and specific areas. 

This is what's on my mind:
- 📊Fatal Casualties , Serious Casualties, Slight Casualties, Casualties By Cars, CY casuaLties vs py CASUALTIES MONTH TREND, CASUALTIES BY ROAD TYPE, Casualties by Road Surface, Casualties by Location /Area, Casualties by Light Condition .

- 🔍 Category and region filters are useful in providing optimal interaction with the dataset.

- 📈 Trends: to shed light on the factors causing accidents.

As a result of this project, I learned a great deal more about data visualization, and data and graphic interaction which are valuable skills for a data manager. 💼
